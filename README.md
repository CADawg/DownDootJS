# DownDootJS
Stop Flag Retaliation on STEEM! Rename them to downdoots so nobody gets annoyed. Nobody can be mad at getting downdooted

## Licence

Our licence is a slightly modified MIT Licence. We have added this:

>  Whilst using DownDootJS, you may not engage in any retaliatory downvotes on the STEEM Blockchain. Retaliatory meaning in retaliation to a downvote recieved, with no other reason.

## Use

Our userscript has only been tested with [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) which has great support for wildcards. It supports Firefox, Opera, Chrome and Edge (as well as some less well known ones) so I believe it to be the best choice. Feel free to use your own userscript software, but it may not work.

## Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to the plugin to make it more efficient. Please fork and then submit a PR detailing what you have changed.

Our current tests are as follows (please check these - note they may not work perfectly atm):

- https://discordapp.com - Please Make sure it can load into chats and doesn't break links containing the word downvote/flag
- https://www.palnet.io/rewarding/@holger80/steemrewarding-com-downvote-trail-has-been-implemented
- https://steempeak.com/ocd/@acidyo/ocdb-newsteem-guidelines
- https://steemd.com/@cadawg

Please also note, we respect capitalisation, so:

- Downvote becomes Downdoot
- downvote becomes downdoot
- Flag becomes Downdoot
- flag becomes downdoot
